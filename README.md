# Cave Mapping with SLAM Thesis Project (Linux Setup)

This repository contains the Linux-side code and setup for my thesis work using LiDAR-based SLAM. It includes:

- ROS packages (LIO-SAM, LeGO-LOAM, etc.)
- Hesai SDK
- IMU data processing scripts
- Sample sensor data

More to be added from the Windows side (C++ & MATLAB) later.

## Structure

- `ros_ws/`: Main ROS workspace
- `hesai_ws/`: SDK integration
- `scripts/`: Python for data conversion
- `data/`: Sample bag and IMU CSV
